# README - Makefiles in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using Makefiles in C programming. Makefiles are a powerful tool for automating the build process of C programs. They simplify the compilation process by specifying dependencies and rules for building various components of the program.

## Why Use Makefiles

Makefiles help manage complex projects with multiple source files and dependencies. They allow you to recompile only the modified files, reducing build times and avoiding unnecessary compilations.

## Basic Structure

A Makefile consists of rules and targets. A rule defines how to build a target. A target is typically an output file generated by the build process.

```makefile
target: dependencies
    # Commands to build the target
```

## Variables in Makefiles

Variables in Makefiles help simplify configuration and reusability. They are defined using the `VARNAME = value` syntax and accessed using `$(VARNAME)`.

```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra

target: dependencies
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o target target.c
```

## Rules and Targets

A Makefile may have multiple rules and targets. The default target, specified as `all`, is built when you run `make` without specifying a target.

```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra

all: target

target: target.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o target target.c

clean:
    rm -f target
```

## Phony Targets

Phony targets are targets that don't represent files but are used for executing commands. They help in organizing tasks.

```makefile
.PHONY: all clean

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra

all: target

target: target.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o target target.c

clean:
    rm -f target
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains a sample Makefile that demonstrates how to build a simple C program using a Makefile. The example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run the example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
