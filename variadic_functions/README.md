# README - Variadic Functions in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using variadic functions in the C programming language. Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments, allowing greater flexibility in function calls and usage.

## Variadic Functions

In C, variadic functions are functions that take a varying number of arguments at runtime. These functions are useful when you want to provide a generic interface to perform actions on multiple arguments.

```c
#include <stdarg.h>

int sum(int num_args, ...) {
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, num_args);

    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_args; i++) {
        int value = va_arg(args, int);
        total += value;
    }

    va_end(args);
    return total;
}
```

## stdarg.h Header

The `<stdarg.h>` header provides the necessary macros and types to work with variadic functions. The macros `va_list`, `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end` are commonly used to handle the variable arguments.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate the usage of variadic functions. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
