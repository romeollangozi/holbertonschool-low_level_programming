# README - Command Line Arguments in C (argc and argv)

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation of the `argc` and `argv` parameters commonly used in C programming to handle command line arguments. When executing a C program from the command line, you can pass additional information to the program via command line arguments. These arguments are received by the `main` function through the `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument vector) parameters.

## Usage

To use command line arguments in your C program, you need to modify the `main` function's signature to accept `argc` and `argv` as parameters. The typical function signature for `main` is:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
```

Where `argc` is the number of command line arguments passed, and `argv` is an array of strings containing the actual arguments.

## Command Line Arguments

When running a C program from the command line, you can pass additional arguments separated by spaces. For example:

```
./my_program arg1 arg2 arg3
```

- `./my_program`: The name of the C executable.
- `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3`: The command line arguments.

The first element of `argv` (i.e., `argv[0]`) contains the name of the program itself, while subsequent elements contain the passed arguments. The total number of arguments, including the program name, is stored in `argc`.

## Examples

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Total number of command line arguments: %d\n", argc);

    printf("Program name: %s\n", argv[0]);

    printf("Arguments:\n");
    for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("%d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Suppose you compile the above code and execute the resulting program with the following command:

```
./my_program apple banana orange
```

The output will be:

```
Total number of command line arguments: 4
Program name: ./my_program
Arguments:
1: apple
2: banana
3: orange
```
