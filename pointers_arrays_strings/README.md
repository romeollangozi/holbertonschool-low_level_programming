# README - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. Pointers allow you to work with memory addresses directly, while arrays and strings are common data structures used for storing multiple values and text.

## Pointers

In C, a pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. Pointers allow you to work with dynamic memory allocation, function calls, and data structures.

```c
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x; // Pointer to the integer variable x
```

## Arrays

An array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. You can access individual elements using their index.

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Integer array of size 5
```

## Strings

In C, a string is an array of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). Strings are used to represent textual data.

```c
char message[] = "Hello, World!"; // String declaration
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate the usage of pointers, arrays, and strings. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
