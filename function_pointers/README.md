# README - Function Pointers in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using function pointers in the C programming language. Function pointers allow you to store the address of functions and invoke them indirectly, providing a powerful way to implement advanced functionality and dynamic behavior in C programs.

## Function Pointers

In C, a function pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of a function. You can call the function indirectly using the function pointer, making it possible to choose and execute functions at runtime dynamically.

## Syntax

The syntax for declaring a function pointer is as follows:

```c
return_type (*function_ptr_name)(parameter_list);
```

- `return_type`: The return type of the function.
- `function_ptr_name`: The name of the function pointer variable.
- `parameter_list`: The list of parameters the function takes (if any).

## Passing Function Pointers

Function pointers are often used as arguments to other functions, allowing you to provide custom behavior. This is commonly seen in callback functions.

```c
void someFunction(int x, void (*callback)(int)) {
    // Do something
    callback(x); // Call the function through the function pointer
}
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate the usage of function pointers. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
