## This is my first project in C
This project consists on learning the basics in C programming accomplishing several small tasks until the end of this project.
Here are some key basics of C programming:
**Syntax**: C programs consist of a series of statements written in the C language. Statements are terminated by a semicolon (;). The main function serves as the entry point of a C program.
**Variables and Data Types**: C supports various data types such as integers (int), floating-point numbers (float, double), characters (char), and more. Variables are declared with a specific data type and can store values of that type.
**Input and Output**: C provides functions like printf() for outputting text to the console and scanf() for accepting input from the user. printf() uses format specifiers to display values of variables in the output.
**Operators**: C supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=), logical operators (&&, ||, !), and assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.). These operators are used to perform mathematical computations, make comparisons, and manipulate variables.
**Control Flow**: C uses control structures like if-else statements, switch-case statements, and loops (while, for, do-while) to control the flow of execution in a program. These structures allow for conditional branching and repetition of code based on certain conditions.
**Functions**: C programs are built using functions, which are modular units of code that perform specific tasks. Functions have a return type (if any), a name, optional parameters, and a body containing the code to be executed.
**Pointers**: C allows the use of pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses. Pointers provide direct access to memory, enabling efficient memory management and manipulation of data structures.
**Arrays**: C supports arrays, which are contiguous blocks of memory used to store multiple elements of the same data type. Arrays can be accessed using indices and are useful for storing collections of data.
**Libraries**: C provides a standard library (stdio.h, math.h, etc.) that contains a set of functions for common tasks. Additionally, C allows the inclusion of external libraries to access more advanced functionality.
Some of the basics we have in this project are :
* How to make our first 'Hello World'
* C variables if, else, while
* Functions and nested loops
* Makefiles
* Pointers, Arrays and Strings
We check our code with betty-style using betty < filename >.
We will see each of the topics in each document more closely.
