# README - Singly Linked Lists in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using singly linked lists in the C programming language. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called nodes, where each node points to the next node in the list.

## Singly Linked List Structure

In C, a basic structure for a singly linked list node can be defined as follows:

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
```

The `data` field holds the value of the node, while the `next` field is a pointer to the next node in the list.

## Basic Operations

The following fundamental operations can be performed on a singly linked list:

1. **Insertion**: Inserting a new node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a node from the list.
3. **Traversal**: Iterating through the list to access and manipulate each node.
4. **Searching**: Searching for a specific element in the list.
5. **Length**: Calculating the length (number of nodes) in the list.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate various operations on singly linked lists. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
