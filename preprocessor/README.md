# README - Preprocessor in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of the C preprocessor. The preprocessor is a critical component of the C compilation process that performs text substitution and macro expansion before the actual compilation of the code.

## Preprocessor Directives

Preprocessor directives are special commands starting with the `#` symbol. They are processed before the actual compilation and can change the source code before it is passed to the compiler.

```c
#include <stdio.h> // Preprocessor directive for including standard input/output library
```

## Macros

Macros are a way to define constants or small code snippets that can be reused throughout the code. They are defined using the `#define` directive.

```c
#define PI 3.1415926 // Macro for defining the value of PI
```

## Conditional Compilation

Conditional compilation allows parts of the code to be included or excluded based on certain conditions. It is commonly used for platform-specific code or debugging.

```c
#ifdef DEBUG
    // Code to be compiled only if the DEBUG macro is defined
#endif
```

## File Inclusion

The `#include` directive is used to include the content of other files in the current source file. It is often used to split code into multiple files for better organization.

```c
#include "header.h" // Include content of header.h in the current source file
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate the usage of preprocessor directives, macros, conditional compilation, and file inclusion. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
