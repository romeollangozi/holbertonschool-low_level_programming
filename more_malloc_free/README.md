# README - Dynamic Memory Allocation in C (malloc and free)

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using dynamic memory allocation in the C programming language using `malloc` and `free` functions. Dynamic memory allocation allows you to allocate memory at runtime, which is essential for creating data structures of variable sizes and managing memory efficiently.

## malloc Function

The `malloc` function in C is used to dynamically allocate memory from the heap. It takes the number of bytes as input and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block if successful, or a NULL pointer if memory allocation fails.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void* malloc(size_t size);
```

## free Function

The `free` function is used to release dynamically allocated memory and return it to the system's memory pool. It takes a pointer to the memory block previously allocated with `malloc` as input.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void free(void* ptr);
```

## Memory Management

Using `malloc` and `free`, you can dynamically manage memory, allocating only the required memory for data structures and deallocating it when it is no longer needed. Proper memory management helps prevent memory leaks and ensures efficient utilization of system resources.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and memory deallocation using `free`. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.

## Disclaimer

The examples provided in this repository are for educational purposes only. Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation require careful management to prevent memory leaks and undefined behavior. Always validate the return values of `malloc` and avoid accessing deallocated memory using `free`.
