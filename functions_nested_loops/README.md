# README - Functions and Nested Loops in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using functions and nested loops in the C programming language. Functions allow you to break down large programs into smaller, manageable pieces, while nested loops provide a powerful way to repeat actions in a structured manner.

## Functions

In C, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It helps in organizing the code and promotes reusability. Functions are typically declared with a return type, a name, and optionally, a list of parameters.

```c
return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
    // Function body
    // Code to perform the task
    // Optionally, return a value using 'return' statement
}
```

## Nested Loops

Nested loops in C allow you to create loops within loops. This is useful when you need to perform repetitive actions in a structured manner. You can have multiple loops inside one another, and the inner loop will repeat its entire cycle for each iteration of the outer loop.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // Outer loop
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        // Inner loop
        // Code to be executed repeatedly
    }
}
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate the usage of functions and nested loops. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
