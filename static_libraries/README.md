# README - Static Libraries in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using static libraries in the C programming language. Static libraries are collections of pre-compiled object files that can be linked with your C programs to provide reusable code and reduce the size of the final executable.

## Creating Static Libraries

To create a static library, you first need to compile your source code into object files. Then, you can use the `ar` (archive) command to bundle the object files into a static library.

```bash
# Compile your source code into object files
gcc -c file1.c -o file1.o
gcc -c file2.c -o file2.o

# Create the static library
ar rcs libexample.a file1.o file2.o
```

The `libexample.a` file is your static library, which contains the compiled code from `file1.o` and `file2.o`.

## Linking Static Libraries

To use a static library in your C program, you need to link it during the compilation process. You can specify the static library using the `-l` flag, followed by the library name (without the `lib` prefix) and the `-L` flag to indicate the library's directory.

```bash
# Compile your C program with the static library
gcc main.c -o my_program -L/path/to/library -lexample
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate how to create and use static libraries. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
