# README - Structures and Typedef in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using structures and typedef in the C programming language. Structures allow you to create user-defined data types that can hold multiple related values. Typedef simplifies the process of creating aliases for existing data types, making the code more readable and maintainable.

## Structures

In C, a structure is a user-defined data type that can hold multiple variables of different types. It allows you to group related data together under a single name.

```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
};
```

## Typedef

Typedef allows you to create an alias for an existing data type, making it easier to use and understand. It simplifies complex type declarations.

```c
typedef int Age; // Create an alias 'Age' for the 'int' data type
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate the usage of structures and typedef. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
