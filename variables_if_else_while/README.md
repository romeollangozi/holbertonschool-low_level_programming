# README - Variables, If-Else Statements, and Control Flow in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using variables and if-else statements in the C programming language. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data, while if-else statements provide a way to make decisions and control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.

## Variables

In C, a variable is a named location in memory that holds a value. Variables must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.

```c
int age; // Declaring an integer variable 'age'
age = 25; // Assigning a value to the 'age' variable
```

## If-Else Statements

If-else statements in C are used for conditional execution. They allow you to execute different code blocks based on whether a given condition is true or false.

```c
int x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    // Code block executed if 'x' is greater than 5
} else {
    // Code block executed if 'x' is not greater than 5
}
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate the usage of variables and if-else statements. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
