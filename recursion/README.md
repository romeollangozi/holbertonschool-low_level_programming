# README - Recursion in C

## Introduction

This README provides an explanation and examples of using recursion in the C programming language. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem in smaller instances, leading to elegant and concise code for certain problems.

## How Recursion Works

In a recursive function, the problem is divided into smaller sub-problems, and the function is called recursively to solve each sub-problem. The recursion continues until a base case is reached, where the function returns a result without making any further recursive calls. The results from each sub-problem are combined to obtain the final solution.

## Base Case

A base case is a condition that stops the recursion and provides a result without any further recursive calls. Without a base case, the recursion can lead to an infinite loop and a stack overflow.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains C code examples that demonstrate the usage of recursion. Each example is well-commented to aid understanding.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
